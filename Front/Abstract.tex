    In this article, an autonomous seafood grasping system was designed and
tested. This system gained from techniques from a lot of fields such as soft
robotics, autonomous control, computer vision, submarine vehicle and embedded
system, which in total supported this system to harvest specific undersea
species with a high precise, rapidly responsible, reasonably robust in complex
natural submarine environment.
