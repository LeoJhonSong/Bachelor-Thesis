\section{Experiments and Results}

\subsection{Lab Tank Experiments}

The system was first validated in a lab tank without the vehicle
(\autoref{f:tank}). The binocular camera was connected to a computer and 2D
relative positions of the manipulator's end effector, the target (rubber models
of sea cucumber, sea urchin and scallop with counterweight inside) are detected from its
video stream there. The processed data was transmitted to a MATLAB program
(prototype of the manipulator controlling algorithm at this early stage) to
calculate demanded air pressures to apply to the chambers of the soft
manipulator. The manipulator was fully submerged into the water and a vibration
pump was involved to simulate water flows in the real submarine environment.
With several tests, it was proved that the system has the ability to detect and
catch the seafood model with acceptable robustness. Limited by the performance
of the computer used and unoptimized algorithm, the whole process (including
detection, calculation of pressures needed with period of 1 seconds and grasp)
took about 3 minutes in average. Besides, this system could not handle targets
moving at a low speed, as well as handling static target when the system was
moving, as another result of the two factors mentioned above.

\subsection{Lab Pool Experiments}

The second stage Experiments were done in a \(5m\times7m\times1.5m\) lab pool at
China Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation. The system had been developed
to as described in \autoref{s:3} at this stage. The autonomous seafood grasping
system passed both static water test and test when random moderate current were
generated by a human being at side, achieving high success rate (46 success out
of 58 attempt). \autoref{f:pool} shows snapshots of each step of how the system
successfully collected the model into its basket. How the \gls{iauv} traverse
the squared pool was shown in \autoref{f:pool} (e).

\subsection{Oceanic Experiments}

The offshore experiments were taken place at the beachside of Jinshitan in
Dalian, China. The results are shown below.
