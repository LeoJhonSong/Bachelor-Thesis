\section{Discussion}

In this article, an autonomous seafood grasping system was designed and tested.
This system gained from techniques from a lot of fields such as soft robotics,
autonomous control, computer vision, submarine vehicle and embedded system,
which in total supported this system to harvest specific undersea species with a
high precise, rapidly responsible, reasonably robust in complex natural
submarine environment. The benefits of introducing soft robotics into undersea
tasks is obvious:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Compliance of the soft manipulator guaranties the integrity of fragile
    targets, and performs much more adaptive compered to traditional rigid
    robotic mechanism.
    \item As a result of materials used, the weight of the manipulator is
    relatively low, contributing low inertia while locomotion (weighted 1.05 kg
    while a normal rigid hydraulic manipulator could claim tens of kilograms).
\end{itemize}

Results from this article provides a promising solution for high-performance,
rapid-responsible, low-cost underwater autonomous operation system for undersea
missions in the future. undersea facility maintenance, seabed pollutants
recycling, biological sampling are covered.
