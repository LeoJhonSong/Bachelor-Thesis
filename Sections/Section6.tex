\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{Contributions}

The main contributions of this article are listed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design and construct a \gls{iauv} system, and carry out a set of
    feasible, robust solution for autonomous seafood grasping and collecting in
    submarine, including target searching, target detecting, path planning,
    inverse kinematics algorithm and so on.
    \item Explored how soft robotics could be developed and integrated on a
    modified \gls{rov} platform.
    \item A simple, low-cost, high efficient solution to resist disturbance of
    currents in a complex underwater environment is proposed. With this
    solution, the robot could search the field in a short time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Work}

In this study, the design shows out be have character of high integration, high
performance and high precise. However, compared to solutions with tradition
rigid manipulator, this system is visibly less efficient, with slow response
which is a notable disadvantage of soft actuators. The effect is especially
obvious in this system because of the 50 meters long pneumatic pipes. In future
works, the pneumatic driving system will be integrated to the vehicle and high
pressure pipes capable of delivering pressure change in a very short time will
be applied. Another improvement direction could be developing a large scale
seafood searcher to provide general direction for the \gls{iauv}.
